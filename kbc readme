# Kon Banega Crorepati (KBC) - Python Console Game 🎮

## 📋 Project Description:

This is a simple Python-based **Quiz Game** inspired by the popular Indian TV show **"Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC)"**.
The player is asked **5 multiple-choice questions**, and upon answering correctly, their **prize money increases** after each question.

If the user answers incorrectly, the game ends immediately and displays the prize money earned until that point.

## 🎯 How It Works:

1. The program displays each question with four answer options.
2. The user selects their answer by typing the **option letter** (A/B/C/D).

   * The player progresses to the next question.
   * Their prize money increases by ₹10,000 per question.
4. If the answer is wrong:

   * The game stops.
   * The player’s last earned amount is displayed.
5. If all 5 questions are answered correctly:

   * The user is declared the **winner**.
